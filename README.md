# Pay-Rent-Automation
I created an automation using Google Sheets to send me an email reminding me to pay rent on the first of every month with a link to my rent-paying website.
When thinking about what tasks I would find automation useful, I realized that most are already automated. My wifi, electricity and gas bills are already on auto-pay, and I don't tend to send recurring emails often. One thing that I forget a lot is to pay my rent, as that is a direct payment to my landlord, so I am not able to auto-pay, nor is there a portal to auto-pay it through. When designing my automation, I decided that the best way to have an automated rent reminder was an email sent a day before it was due with a way for me to pay my landlord on it. When making the actual automation, I kept it quite simple, using Google Sheets and app script, selecting a time-based trigger for the first of every month.
